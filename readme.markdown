What is FubuLinks?
--

FubuLinks is a little sample application used in blog posts, webinars, and screencasts to get you started with FubuMVC. It's simple, concise, and gets the point across (we hope).

Where is CommonAssemblyInfo.cs?
--

CommonAssemblyInfo.cs is generated by the build. The build script requires Ruby with rake installed.

If you do not have ruby:

1. You need to manually create a src/CommonAssemblyInfo.cs file 

  * type: `echo // > src/CommonAssemblyInfo.cs`
  
1. open src/FubuLinks.sln with Visual Studio and Build the solution
